			<h2>Corruption: A Way to Happiness</h2>
			<p id="name" style="gray">Written October 28, 2020<p>
			<p id="essay">Undeniably, there are several people who don’t earn enough to provide for the needs of their families. In this world of 
			cruelty and despair, many lose hope and stop searching for solutions. Regrettably yet inevitably, some people would prefer to succumb to 
			death than live in this world any longer. However, these people need only enlightenment to improve their way of life; and I, if I may humbly 
			do so, would like to propose a solution to our country’s current predicament.</p>
			<p id="essay">There are many opportunities and possibilities in life. Solutions to improve one’s economic welfare are abounding. For instance, 
			you can turn your hobbies into your source of income. However, rather than committing oneself to arduous tasks, only one answer is certified 
			to bring us wealth almost instantly, and it would be none other than our perennial friend, corruption.</p>
			<p id="essay">Since forever, corruption has been present in our world; and during its lifetime, it has garnered the hate and criticism of most. 
			Until now, I had not an inkling as to why people treat it as something atrocious when it is most logical and justifiable. For those of you who 
			are skeptics of my ideals, it would be my honor to show you that corruption is an ideal path to success so as to expand your mind even in the 
			slightest sliver.</p>
			<p id="essay">Throughout the years, many intellectuals have believed that human nature would do anything to fulfill their desires. According 
			to Thomas Hobbes, a knowledgeable philosopher, humans would carry out any action to aid their survival even though it may harm someone else. 
			The loathsome responses towards corruption only bewilder me more. In corporations and daily life, it is common for people to drag their opponents 
			down, a phenomenon called “The Crab Mentality.” For the benefit of oneself, this is not an unusual occurrence. Since raking away some funds from 
			the country would be in the same category as the Crab Mentality, corruption should be normalized to alleviate the desires growing within the hearts 
			of our people in our society.</p>
			<p id="essay">Another reason as to why corruption is an abomination to most is because it brings detrimental effects to our country’s economy. 
			Corruption hinders economic growth and causes an uneven distribution of wealth. Nevertheless, instead of being the one affected by corruption, 
			be the corruptor. Although it may sound impossible and intimidating, think of the many benefits corruption may give and you’ll be given enough 
			inspiration to continue down this path. Looking upon the role models in the history of corruption would also provide assistance and guidance 
			toward your goal.</p>
			<p id="essay">There are many people in history who have committed corruption, and they always get away with it in the end. For instance, a 
			recent case of corruption would be by Bong Revilla. He was charged for plunder after being involved in the well-known pork barrel scam case. 
			After being imprisoned for four years, Sandiganbayan decides to acquit him of his crimes because of the “lack of quantum evidence.” He even returns
			to work again for the government, which shows his perseverance and his fortitude to forge the path of corruption once again.</p>
			<p id="essay">Another example would be Ferdinand E. Marcos, the most capable president in Philippine history.  He spent his reign as the president 
			taking full control of our country through martial law and spending his life full of luxury by stealing from the Philippine budget and loaning some 
			money from the world bank. After he was ousted from his position because of the utterly nonsensical People Power Revolution, he and his wife were 
			charged with graft and premeditated murder. He was supposed to receive the death penalty, yet instead, he was exiled into Honolulu, Hawaii. There 
			he and his beloved wife lived a comfortable life of lavish luxury. They stayed in a multi-million-dollar home, dined in high-class restaurants every 
			day, and shopped for designer clothes. In exchange for imprisonment, they get to experience this life until their last breath. With all honesty, 
			wouldn’t you want to do the same?</p>
			<p id="essay">If you get caught and charged for your crime by chance, it isn’t the end for your thieving legacy. After a few years have passed and 
			memories of the crime have simmered down, corrupt officials have the audacity to run for upcoming elections. The surprising thing about this is that 
			they win, all because of their swift name recognition after being mentioned by the news several times. As mentioned, an example would be Bong Revilla, 
			who is currently a senator working for the government.</p>
			<p id="essay">Corruption is an admirable act, and merely reading this mellifluous word gives warmth to my heart. It emancipates the hidden desires 
			of people, liberating us from the burden of unfollowed dreams. It is my hope that the world would continue this legacy onto the following generations 
			to let them have a taste of what it feels to be alive.</p>

			<p id="rant">Why does Daisuke give "my-company-has-slush-funds" vibes? I mean he definitely isn't the type to do that, but sometimes I kinda doubt the
